        <p><b>The proposal to start an Indian Institute of Management</b> in the Northeast was unanimously taken in June 2004 by the Union Minister of Human Resource Development along with
             the Chief Ministers of the North Eastern states in the review meeting held at Shillong.[2] Shillong was drafted as the permanent location for the institute after consultation between the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDONER) and the Chief Ministers of the states.[3]

            The foundation stone for the institute was laid by Shri. Arjun Singh, Union Minister of Human Resource Development.
             on 1 December 2007.[4] The admittance of the first batch of students for 
             the Post-Graduate Programme was formally inaugurated by Dr Donkupar Roy, Chief Minister of Meghalaya, on 4 July 2008.[5]
            
            The institute was set up at the Mayurbhanj Palace, the summer retreat of the Mayurbhanj Kings of Odisha. 
            The Palace was renovated by the Meghalaya government[6] with the construction of a permanent 
            campus in development at Umsawli.
            The first chairman of the Board of Governors was Shri. 
            Rathindra Nath Dutta, and the first director, Prof Ashoke K. Dutta.</p>
